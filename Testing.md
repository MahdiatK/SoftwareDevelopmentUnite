This is a file that will be used throughout development to highlight testing.

Ran into an issue with naming files but after it ran correctly:

The issue was resolved by changing the name of the login page file to .dart as now it is properly undestood

I have been coding side by side with Andriod Studio - A andriod phone emulator it looks like this and this what what i have done upto now:

In development faced alot of comon errors in indentation adn parenthesis these are some of them:

This issue was fixed to allow the app to run, the changes i made was to change the position of the parenthesis it had to be on the same line as the color scheme primary code,
Also i made the code more neat and readable, fixing some of the indentation here is the fixed version:

In the development we wanted to you usernames as a way for the user to login, however when it came to the data section firefox would only allow us to use email instead of username for when users sign up
