## Testing
This is a file that will be used throughout development to highlight testing.

Ran into an issue with naming files but after it ran correctly:
<img width="2549" height="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e76994-876c-43fa-bf1a-8f48889f929c" />
The issue was resolved by changing the name of the login page file to .dart as now it is properly undestood
