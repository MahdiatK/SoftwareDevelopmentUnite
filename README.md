  # <ins> Reviewing Available Projects <ins/>
## Hangman
A simple, GUI multiplater game where players take turns guessing letters to reveal a hidden word, with ach incorrect guess adding to a 'hangman' drawing.

Target audience;
- This will be catered towards students, casual gamers or anyone looking for a quick game that they can play with a group of people

Considerations;
- Difficulty level, simple, intuitive gameplay
- Platform, likely to be played on desktop or mobile
- Multiplater, it would require syncing between players and managing turn taking on the game

Pros;
- Easy to implement and can be made with simple graphics
- Fun for all ages

Cons;
- Could get repetivie, may need to add creative elements to make it fresh
- May require extensive html, java code to make it look aesthetically pleasing and futuristic

## Hide and seek
Players can hide either objects or their avatars within a game mode, while another player (team) tries to find them. 

Target audience;
- This would be catered towards younger players (kids and teenagers), it may be appealing for small groups of people who enjoy multiplayer games.

Considerations;
- Game design, the hiding areas must be dynamic full with objects
- Multiplayer, involve different roles such as hiders and seekers, potentially multiple people in each team
- Technology, a simple 2 dimensional environment to host the game

Pros;
- Other a variatey of ways to play the game
- Encourages creativity in how players of the game design their hiding spots

Cons;
- Development could be more complex, especially if good graphics needed
- Might appeal to a narrower audience 

## Chat App
A simple text based chat app, multiple users can send messages to each other. Text formatting, private/group messaging and file sharing could be features involved in this app.

Target audience;
- Social users, students-anyone who communicates regulary and wants to used a customized chat app to communicate with others. It could be used for casual users or communites/businesses with specific needs

Considerations;
- Security, Either a basic messaging system, or if it requires a username and password to access the system
- User experience, easy-to=use interface, real-time messaging and notifications systems when receiving messages from others
- Multiplayer, Real-time nature of talking to others, be able to hold multiple users at once

Pros;
- Demand is high for chat apps
- Can add features like user profiles, media sharing and video calls

Cons;
- Can be challenging to make (data base management of users)
- Highly competitive market
- Will need alot of time spent on coding 

# <ins> Reviewing Target Audiences <ins/>
As any software project goes, it's essential to plan and build around an intended target audience. For the chosen project of building functioning mobile-ready Chat App, there are multiple possible target audiences to consider from:

## Family and Friends
Chacteristics;
- Prefer a simple, friendly interface
- Lightweight features
- Primarily mobile based usage

## Students
Chacteristics;
- Use messaging apps daily
- Need fast, simple communication
- Often collaborate in virtual spaces
- Appeals to engaging, intuitive UI

## Workforce Teams
Chacteristics;
- Need reliability and message persistence
- May need channels, tagging, or file exchange
- Values security


# <ins> Intended Primary Target Audience <ins/>
## Family and Friends

The project will be completed with casual use in mind, for families and friends who need an easy and convenient way of communication. This demographic will be favoring ease of use, instant messaging and an intuitive, accessible UI. By targeting users who prefer casual communication, the project can focus on core messaging without requiring more complex functionalities to support team-based environments. This will let the project fall under a realistic and achievable scope of work, as the members don't have extensive experience in designing mobile apps, or java.

# Usability
The game will have a simple navigation system with clear visual cues to understand what next to do, the chat app allows users of all ages to understand how to use the app and get started via creating an account.

# Feedback style
when sending a message to someone else, it will have a verification bar next to the message, one bar to show its sent and two bars to show it has been sent and read. If a user ypes and is about to send an incomplete message, the ap could suggest improvements or format corrections.

# Basic needs
Each user will have a profile with an avatar and username, each user has options to create direct or groups messages (up to 12). Search functionality for finding old chats or different contacts, finally message history with ability to see previous messages from few weeks back.
 
 # Error handling
If a message can't be sent due to connectivity issues, users should receive a notification saying something went wrong "please check your connections and try again", a retry button to try resend a undelivered messae and a offline warning, messages saved until other user back online to receive it.

## Potential Project Risks

# Technical arcitecture #
- The app may not be designed to handle multiple users simultaneously texting, this could lead to crashes, message delays or loss of messages.

# Real time communication #
- Real time messaging protocols may exceed the teams technical familiarity, we have to research alot of these protocols before we can use them, poor implementation can lead to unreliable communication.

# Testing and quality assurance #
- Inadequate unit testing, increases amount of bugs, slow development

# Security vulnerabilities # 
- Week authentication, unsafe message storage, Chat apps deal with sensitive user information so security flaws can compromise user trust and violate regulations

# Api dependancies #
- Reliance on hosted cloud services, outages or deprecations can break and slow down the apps features leading to unhappy customers

# Integration between front and backend #
- Mismatched data formats, incosistent API behaviour, miscomunnication, these all can lead to core feaatures breaking or behaving unpredicitably

# Database design problems #
- Poor schema choices, this could result in slow message retrieval or lost messages

# Limited deployment knowledge #
- Possible difficulty deploying servers, this could lead to deployment errors making the system unusable

## Core requirements ##

# User Accounts #
- Register, login, logout
- Profile management (username, avatar, status)

# Real-Time Messaging #
- One-to-one chat
- Group chats
- Message sending, receiving, editing, deleting
- Typing indicators and read receipts

# Media Support #
- Send images, videos, documents, voice notes

# Notifications #
- Push notifications for new messages
- Contact Management
- Add/remove contacts
- Search contacts

# Additional (Optional) Features #
- Voice/video calls
- Status updates
- Multi-device sync
- Message backup/export
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE) or at minimum message encryption in transit (TLS)
- Secure user authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT, or password-based authentication with hashing)

## basic pseudo coide ##

# Login #
function registerUser(username, password):
    if usernameExists(username):
        return "Username taken"
    hashedPassword = hash(password)
    saveToDatabase(username, hashedPassword)
    return "Registration successful"
    

function loginUser(username, password):
    if !usernameExists(username):
        return "User not found"
    if compareHash(password, getStoredHash(username)):
        createSession(username)
        return "Login successful"
    else:
        return "Invalid credentials"

# send messages #
function sendMessage(senderID, receiverID, messageText):
    encryptedText = encrypt(messageText, receiverPublicKey)
    message = createMessageObject(senderID, receiverID, encryptedText)
    saveToDatabase(message)
    pushToReceiver(receiverID, message)
    return "Message Sent"

# Create group chat #
function createGroupChat(creatorID, memberList):
    groupID = generateGroupID()
    saveGroup(groupID, creatorID, memberList)
    notifyMembers(memberList)
    return groupID

## Establishing Game state ##

<img width="567" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53562708-8607-4b0c-82c1-3e8c3a49a003" />

# How states are detected #
- Start state triggered when the app loads (AppDelegate / MainActivity)
- Authentication state detected by checking if user token exists
- Chat open state triggered by navigation (open chat ID)
- Message events triggered by server socket/WebSocket/HTTP events
- Error state triggered by network failure or invalid response

# How states change #
- Navigation (user taps chat → CHAT_OPEN)
- User interactions (send message → MESSAGE_SENT)
- Server events (incoming message → MESSAGE_RECEIVED)
- Authentication success/failure
- Errors and exception handling

# State Logic #
- state = "START"

- if appOpened:
     state = "AUTH"

- if loginSuccessful:
    state = "HOME"

- if userSelectsChat:
    state = "CHAT_OPEN"

- if userSendsMessage:
    state = "MESSAGE_SENT"

- if receiveMessageEvent:
    state = "MESSAGE_RECEIVED"

- if errorOccurs:
    state = "ERROR"

- if userLogsOut:
    state = "LOGOUT"

## Refrences
To develop the app we chose to use Flutter framework and Cloud Firestore (Firebase). The flutter framework is essential to build the mobile app’s interface and logic for both Android and iOS from a single codebase. And Firestore is essential to store user data, messages, and real-time updates.
To use both of these we had to learn the basics and used the following websites:
- https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#1
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?_gl=1*12ydv1y*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU4MTYyNTQxMS4xNzY1MTMyMjEw*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*czE3NjUxMzIyMDkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjUxMzIyMDkkajYwJGwwJGgw
- https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick
  
I used the following youtube channel called Mitch Koko to help me with flutter and he has alot of tutoral videos:
