## Potential Project Risks

### Technical Architecture
The app may not be designed to handle multiple users simultaneously texting, leading to crashes, message delays, or loss of data.

### Real-Time Communication
Real-time messaging protocols may exceed the team's technical familiarity, requiring research. Poor implementation leads to unreliable communication.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
Lack of unit testing increases the number of bugs and slows development.

### Security Vulnerabilities
Weak authentication or unsafe message storage may compromise user trust and violate security standards.

### API Dependencies
Reliance on cloud services creates risks of outages, version conflicts, and performance issues.

### Integration Between Front-End and Back-End
Mismatched data formats or inconsistent API behaviour can break core functionality.

### Database Design Problems
Weak schema design can slow message retrieval or cause inconsistent data.

### Limited Deployment Knowledge
Server deployment issues may cause downtime or system instability.

---

## basic pseudo code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if usernameExists(username):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Username taken"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hashedPassword = hash(password)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saveToDatabase(username, hashedPassword)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Registration successful"  

function loginUser(username, password):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if !usernameExists(username):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "User not found"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if compareHash(password, getStoredHash(username)):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;createSession(username)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Login successful"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Invalid credentials"  


### send messages

function sendMessage(senderID, receiverID, messageText):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encryptedText = encrypt(messageText, receiverPublicKey)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message = createMessageObject(senderID, receiverID, encryptedText)

## Establishing Game State

### How states are detected
- Start state triggered when the app loads (AppDelegate / MainActivity)  
- Authentication state detected by checking if user token exists  
- Chat open state triggered by navigation (open chat ID)  
- Message events triggered by server socket/WebSocket/HTTP events  
- Error state triggered by network failure or invalid response  

### How states change
- Navigation (user taps chat → CHAT_OPEN)  
- User interactions (send message → MESSAGE_SENT)  
- Server events (incoming message → MESSAGE_RECEIVED)  
- Authentication success/failure  
- Errors and exception handling  

### State Logic
- state = "START"  
- if appOpened: state = "AUTH"  
- if loginSuccessful: state = "HOME"  
- if userSelectsChat: state = "CHAT_OPEN"  
- if userSendsMessage: state = "MESSAGE_SENT"  
- if receiveMessageEvent: state = "MESSAGE_RECEIVED"  
- if errorOccurs: state = "ERROR"  
- if userLogsOut: state = "LOGOUT"  

---

## System Architecture Overview

### Data Requirements
- UserID  
- Username  
- PasswordHash  
- Avatar (optional)  
- Status (online/offline)  

### Message Data Structure
- MessageID  
- RoomID  
- SenderID  
- Timestamp  
- MessageText  

### Constraints
- The system must support multiple active rooms  
- Only text messages (and optional emojis)  
- Must run efficiently on low-spec mobile devices

## References

To develop the app we chose to use Flutter framework and Cloud Firestore (Firebase). The flutter framework is essential to build the mobile app’s interface and logic for both Android and iOS from a single codebase. And Firestore is essential to store user data, messages, and real-time updates.  
To use both of these we had to learn the basics and used the following websites:

- https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#1  
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore  
- https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick  

We also used the following YouTube channel for learning Flutter:
