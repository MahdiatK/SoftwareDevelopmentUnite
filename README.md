# Reviewing Available Projects

## Hangman
A simple, GUI multiplater game where players take turns guessing letters to reveal a hidden word, with ach incorrect guess adding to a 'hangman' drawing.

Target audience;
- This will be catered towards students, casual gamers or anyone looking for a quick game that they can play with a group of people

Considerations;
- Difficulty level, simple, intuitive gameplay
- Platform, likely to be played on desktop or mobile
- Multiplater, it would require syncing between players and managing turn taking on the game

Pros;
- Easy to implement and can be made with simple graphics
- Fun for all ages

Cons;
- Could get repetivie, may need to add creative elements to make it fresh
- May require extensive html, java code to make it look aesthetically pleasing and futuristic

## Hide and Seek
Players can hide either objects or their avatars within a game mode, while another player (team) tries to find them. 

Target audience;
- This would be catered towards younger players (kids and teenagers), it may be appealing for small groups of people who enjoy multiplayer games.

Considerations;
- Game design, the hiding areas must be dynamic full with objects
- Multiplayer, involve different roles such as hiders and seekers, potentially multiple people in each team
- Technology, a simple 2 dimensional environment to host the game

Pros;
- Other a variatey of ways to play the game
- Encourages creativity in how players of the game design their hiding spots

Cons;
- Development could be more complex, especially if good graphics needed
- Might appeal to a narrower audience 

## Chat App
A simple text based chat app, multiple users can send messages to each other. Text formatting, private/group messaging and file sharing could be features involved in this app.

Target audience;
- Social users, students-anyone who communicates regulary and wants to used a customized chat app to communicate with others. It could be used for casual users or communites/businesses with specific needs

Considerations;
- Security, Either a basic messaging system, or if it requires a username and password to access the system
- User experience, easy-to=use interface, real-time messaging and notifications systems when receiving messages from others
- Multiplayer, Real-time nature of talking to others, be able to hold multiple users at once

Pros;
- Demand is high for chat apps
- Can add features like user profiles, media sharing and video calls

Cons;
- Can be challenging to make (data base management of users)
- Highly competitive market
- Will need alot of time spent on coding

# Reviewing Target Audiences

## Family and Friends
Chacteristics;
- Prefer a simple, friendly interface
- Lightweight features
- Primarily mobile based usage

## Students
Chacteristics;
- Use messaging apps daily
- Need fast, simple communication
- Often collaborate in virtual spaces
- Appeals to engaging, intuitive UI

## Workforce Teams
Chacteristics;
- Need reliability and message persistence
- May need channels, tagging, or file exchange
- Values security

## Intended Primary Target Audience
### Family and Friends

The project will be completed with casual use in mind, for families and friends who need an easy and convenient way of communication. This demographic will be favoring ease of use, instant messaging and an intuitive, accessible UI. By targeting users who prefer casual communication, the project can focus on core messaging without requiring more complex functionalities to support team-based environments. This will let the project fall under a realistic and achievable scope of work, as the members don't have extensive experience in designing mobile apps, or java.

Inadequate unit testing increases bugs and slows development.

## Security Vulnerabilities
Weak authentication or unsafe message storage can compromise user trust.

## API Dependencies
Reliance on hosted cloud services can cause outages.

## Integration Between Front-End and Back-End
Mismatched data formats and inconsistent API behaviour can break features.

# Establishing Game State

## How states are detected
- Start state triggered when the app loads (AppDelegate / MainActivity)
- Authentication state detected by checking if user token exists
- Chat open state triggered by navigation (open chat ID)
- Message events triggered by server socket/WebSocket/HTTP events
- Error state triggered by network failure or invalid response

## How states change
- Navigation (user taps chat → CHAT_OPEN)
- User interactions (send message → MESSAGE_SENT)
- Server events (incoming message → MESSAGE_RECEIVED)
- Authentication success/failure
- Errors and exception handling

## State Logic
- state = "START"  
- if appOpened: state = "AUTH"  
- if loginSuccessful: state = "HOME"  
- if userSelectsChat: state = "CHAT_OPEN"  
- if userSendsMessage: state = "MESSAGE_SENT"  
- if receiveMessageEvent: state = "MESSAGE_RECEIVED"  
- if errorOccurs: state = "ERROR"  
- if userLogsOut: state = "LOGOUT"  

---

# System Architecture Overview

## Data Requirements
- UserID

- Avatar (optional)  
- Status (online/offline)  

## Message Data Structure

- RoomID  
- SenderID  
- Timestamp  
- MessageText  

## Constraints
- The system must support multiple active rooms  
- Only text messages + optional emojis  
- Must run efficiently on low-spec mobile devices
